## Introduction

The primary goal of this project is to understand and predict insurance claim amounts based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and more. We used machine learning techniques to build a predictive model.

## Data Analysis

We started by loading and exploring the dataset. This included encoding categorical features, visualizing data, and identifying the most correlated factors with insurance charges.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps involved handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In our EDA, we created visualizations to better understand the relationships between variables and uncover insights that could inform our modeling.

## Model Building

We used linear regression as a starting point to build a predictive model for estimating insurance claim amounts. The model was evaluated using appropriate metrics.

## Results

The linear regression model achieved an R-squared score of approximately 0.7962 on the test data, indicating its predictive capability. Further improvements and additional models may be explored.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries were used in this project:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
